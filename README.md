## Vinod's Github Repositories

I'm currently working at Microsoft and most of my repositories fall into one of these four categories:
1. Repos I contribute to for product docs, samples and demos
2. Repos I started for demos and samples I built 
3. Repos I started for ideas I'm either playing with or trying to learn more about
4. Repos that I clones with the intention of doing something about, but have just not found the time :)
